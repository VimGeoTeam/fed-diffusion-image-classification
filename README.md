# fed-diffusion-image-classification
This project explores data augmentation strategies for federated image classification, leveraging diffusion models to generate synthetic data. The approach enhances the local datasets of federated clients in non-IID environments, aiming to improve the overall performance and robustness of the global model while preserving privacy.
